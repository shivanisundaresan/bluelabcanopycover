## Who Are We and What Are Our Goals:
We are a group of 6 students at the University of Michigan who are all passionate about sustainability and engineering. We belong to the club BLUElab metro which focuses on sustainability initiatives on campus. With the help of another project team, we planted about 30 trees on campus, and our goal was to create a visualization that represented the carbon offset of those trees in Ann Arbor. 

## Background Information:
To start our project, we needed to research a couple things first. We looked into the types of trees we planted, and found many sources for how to calculate the carbon offset of each tree. We thought a lot about how our work would be utilized in our community so we discussed our project with many stakeholders, and considered how we can make our work accessible. 

## Calculators used:
While there are a wide variety of ways to calculate the carbon offset of trees, we found that using a combination of these two calcuatiors worked best with the data that we acquired. 
1. Tree height/dbh prediction:  https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/urban-tree-database
2. Carbon offset calculation: https://www.ecomatcher.com/how-to-calculate-co2-sequestration/
