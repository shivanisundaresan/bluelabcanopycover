# BlueLabMetro Canopy Cover Carbon Offset

## Us and Our Goals:
We are a group of 6 students at the University of Michigan who are all passionate about sustainability and engineering. We belong to the club BLUElab metro which focuses on sustainability initiatives on campus. With the help of another project team, we planted about 30 trees on campus, and our goal was to dive into the effects those trees have on the carbon footprint of Ann Arbor.

## Background information:
To start our project, we needed to research a couple things first. We looked into the types of trees we planted, and found many sources for how to calculate the carbon offset of each tree. We thought a lot about how our work would be utilized in our community so we discussed our project with many stakeholders, and considered how we can make our work accessible. 

## Calculators used:
1. Tree height/dbh prediction:  https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/urban-tree-database
2. Carbon offset calculation: https://www.ecomatcher.com/how-to-calculate-co2-sequestration/
